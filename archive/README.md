Archived API helpers and backups

- `api-force-runtime-logs.bak.js` - archived runtime log helper.
- `recipe-search.bak.ts`, `recipe-details.bak.ts`, `fetch-ical.bak.ts` - archived TypeScript backups.

These files were moved into `/archive` to keep the active `api/` directory minimal for production deployment.
